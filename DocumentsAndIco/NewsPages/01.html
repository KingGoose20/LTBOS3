                    <p style="text-align: left;"><span class="section-heading centered">After</span> a new draft, some
                        free agent signings, a
                        magical injury recovery, and three days of preseason basketball, the regular season is about to
                        commence. The reigning champions, the Loose Gooses, are currently tied in first with the 5
                        Musketeers, who each have 7 ladder points. The Wet Willies trail behind in third with 4
                        points.<br><br>
                        So far, the duo of Alexander Galt and Samuel McConaghy have continued to dominate, combining for
                        an average of 10 points per day, already 4 points higher than last season. While their chemistry
                        is hard to match, the depth of the Musketeers are clearly limited; on the lone day where they
                        were missing their big man, they won just 14% of games, compared to 75% over the first two days.
                        GM Samuel McConaghy continues to show off his midrange ability, averaging 3 per day, an increase
                        of 1.33. While their third man, Nicholas Szogi, is currently averaging 0.5ppg more than last
                        season, we are yet to see the 5 Musketeers truly utilise him.<br><br>
                        The Loose Gooses continue to perform to their usual, winning 58% of their games, 8% higher than
                        last season. While the returning core of Angus Walker, William Kim, and Christopher Tomkinson,
                        are
                        playing well together, they are still trying to figure out how to best play alongside Jasper
                        Collier and Conor Farrington. MVP Christopher Tomkinson keeps on shining, as he averages
                        2.33ppg, the 4th highest in the league. Despite having a quiet first day, their GM has shown his
                        improved scoring ability, getting it done from the paint, midrange, and from three.<br><br>
                        Without their GM Rudy Hoschke (out due to injury), the Wet Willies have started off slow. After
                        not winning a single game on Day 1, they've managed to improve slightly, winning 27% of games
                        over Day 2 and 3. Retained player Michael Iffland has so far been quiet, something their GM
                        hasn't
                        been afraid to comment about. After averaging 2ppg last season, he seems to have lost some
                        confidence in his
                        ability. If he can get back on track, the future of the Wet Willies looks bright(er). Free agent
                        Clarrie Jones made a miraculous recovery, playing all days throughout the preseason despite
                        being 'out for 6 weeks', and new LTBO member William Scott has performed well, scoring 1 point
                        over two days, and has used his size to get rebounds, and has stood his ground
                        defensively.<br><br><br><br>
                        <span class="section-heading centered">While</span> the win percentages may not show it, I
                        believe that the LTBO is the most balanced its been ever. After a dissapointing second season,
                        the Wet Willies have racked up some talent, and when their GM returns, they could be a
                        consistent
                        second-place team. The Loose Gooses and 5 Musketeers continue to battle for first, each win
                        being a narrow one and hard earned. While the 5 Musketeers have great talent, the chance of
                        neither Alexander Galt nor 9th pick Mitch Yue playing will make it difficult for them to build
                        any big lead on the ladder. In contrast, the consistency of the Loose Gooses might be their
                        strongest aspect (quite the opposite of their first season).
                        Last season there was a total of 5 missed games from their current squad, which includes 4
                        missed days due to a hip injury to their GM. <br><br>There's no doubt that this season will be action
                        packed, and I can't wait to see what we have coming up.
